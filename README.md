## Story

Prometheus, the titan renowned for his wisdom, is outraged by the selfishness of the Olympian gods as humanity suffers in darkness. He decides to steal the sacred flame to save mankind, facing divine obstacles and sentinels. His journey is marked by sacrifice and hope, carrying not only the flame but the future of humanity. Even after being captured and condemned by Zeus, Prometheus strives to deliver the fire, freeing humanity from darkness—despite facing eternal torture. The fate of humanity is in his hands — and he cannot fail.
